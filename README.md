We were 3 on the project:

* **DrawRunner** implemented the gameplay, integrated assets and created basic animations. 
* **Hiku** was in charge of the game-design from its definition to its implementation. He also made background musics and audio effets. 
* **Kastaff** created all 3D assets (map + 3 variants for each type of entity) and artworks.
